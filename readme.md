#simple-validation.js#
Extremely simple form validation with jQuery. Checks if text inputs are filled and if email inputs contain valid email on un-focus or submit. I will soon add support for other elements as well!

Now, it will validate all forms unless told not to. In order to have a form not validated, you can either add the class `novalidate` or you can add the attribute `novalidate` to the form element. Also, in order to specify a specific input in a form to not be validated, you can do the same; add the class `novalidate` or the attribute `novalidate` to the specified form input and it will not be validated.

##Supported Elements## (we are continuously adding to this list!)
- input[type="checkbox"]
- input[type="email"]
- input[type="text"]
- textarea

##Road Map##
Add support for other form elements such as checkboxes, radio buttons, and dropdowns.
