Checks if text inputs are filled and if email inputs contain valid email on un-focus or submit. I will soon add support for other elements as well!\r\n\r\n\r\n~~Add `.validate-form` on forms that you'd like to be validated, and `.validate` on the inputs you'd liked checked. You can use this multiple times on the same page.~~\r\nNow, it will validate all forms unless told not to. In order to have a form not validated, you can either add the class `novalidate` or you can add the attribute `novalidate` to the form element. Also, in order to specify a specific input in a form to not be validated, you can do the same; add the class `novalidate` or the attribute `novalidate` to the specified form input and it will not be validated.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Road Map\r\n\r\nAdd support for other form elements such as checkboxes, radio buttons, and dropdowns.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
