simple-validation
=================

Extremely simple form validation with JQuery. Checks if text inputs are filled and if email inputs contain valid email on un-focus. 


Add `.validate-form` on forms that you'd like to be validated, and `.validate` on the inputs you'd liked checked. You can use this multiple times on the same page.


## Road Map

Add support for other form elements such as checkboxes, radio buttons, and dropdowns.
